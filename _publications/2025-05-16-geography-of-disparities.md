#excerpt: 'Racial disparities in access to medical care are pervasive in the United States. We combine a simple model of healthcare utilization with empirical methods for estimating causal place effects to study the role of geography in driving these disparities. First, we show that the national Black-white access disparity in a given year can be decomposed into person and place components. We present two such decompositions, one where we assume that place effects are homogeneous and one where we allow for race-specific place effects (place-by-race effects). We then estimate these two decompositions using Medicare claims data from 2008-2018 and a mover design that leverages beneficiary migration across areas to estimate causal place effects. When place effects are assumed to be homogeneous, place matters very little for disparities. However, when place effects can vary by race, place matters enormously. Crucially, this place-by-race component is driven almost entirely by the fact that Black and white beneficiaries face very different, largely uncorrelated place effects in a given area, not because of differences in geographic sorting by race. Using a series of empirical exercises, we demonstrate the importance of these different place effects for access to medical care and the potential of different classes of policies to close disparities. We also show that our results are not driven by differential noise in our Black place effect estimates and hold for various levels of geographic granularity. Ultimately, our results suggest that while place-based policies are unlikely to close access disparities, more-targeted place-by-race-based policies are a promising path toward improving racial equity in utilization of healthcare services.'
