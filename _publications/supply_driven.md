excerpt: 'Home health care has long been characterized as highly responsive to supply-side factors. Despite this widespread perception, there is limited direct evidence on how supply affects patterns of use. This study leverages variation in home health agency entry and exit across time and local areas to examine the supply sensitivity of home health care and its downstream consequences. Analyzing how changes in home health supply differentially affect post-acute versus community-entry patients reveals stark differences in responsiveness: although changes in supply have minimal effects on post-acute care use, they substantially increase community-entry use . Beyond these direct effects on use, expanded access generates complex shifts in broader healthcare use. These effects operate through both substitution and complementarity channels: expanded access reduces hospitalizations and Medicaid-funded nursing homes, but also increases prescription drug use and hospice use. The increase in total Medicare spending suggests that expanded home health access represents a net addition to Medicare services rather than pure substitution. Together, these two sets of results - the differential supply sensitivity between care pathways and the complex healthcare use patterns that result from expanded access - challenge the conventional view of home health care as primarily a substitute for institutional post-acute care.'
